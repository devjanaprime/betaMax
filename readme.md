History:
===
I really dig the game Anti|Piracy, but Charles won't give me a build. At GlitchCon17 I kept pestering him for one and he said "if I had a way to distribute a beta like what you've got for Newt One...". So, of course, *lightbulb* and I'm making this now. Hopefully it'll be helpful for other indie game devs.

Future:
===
- api functionality
- stats! numbers! stuff like that!
